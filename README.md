## Voice Functionality

The assistant includes voice capabilities powered by the OpenAI Agents SDK. This allows users to:

1. Speak to the assistant using their microphone
2. Hear the assistant's responses through audio

To use this feature:

1. Ensure you have installed the voice dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Click the "Voice" button in the chat interface
3. Grant microphone permissions when prompted
4. Start speaking to the assistant

The voice functionality uses OpenAI's text-to-speech and speech-to-text models for high-quality audio processing.
